            <h1>ABOUT OUR COMPANY</h1>
            <p>Boston Dynamics is a world leader in mobile robots, tackling some of the toughest robotics 
                challenges. We combine the principles of dynamic control and balance with sophisticated 
                mechanical designs, cutting-edge electronics, and next-generation software for high-performance robots equipped with perception, 
                navigation, and intelligence. Boston Dynamics has an extraordinary and fast-growing technical team of engineers and scientists who seamlessly 
                combine advanced analytical thinking with bold engineering and boots-in-the-mud practicality.

            <h2>FAQS ABOUT BOSTON DYNAMICS</h2>
            <p><strong>Why does Boston Dynamics make legged robots?</strong></p>
            <p>Boston Dynamics focuses on creating robots with advanced mobility, dexterity and intelligence. We have long held that mobility
                 sufficient to access both the natural and the built world required legs. We began the pursuit of this dream over 30 years ago, first in academia 
                 and then as part of Boston Dynamics because it was an exciting technical challenge and because to build a highly mobile robot required it. We wanted 
                 to build a robot that could go where people go. The commonly referred to “dull, dirty and dangerous” tasks don’t occur solely on a neatly organized factory 
                 floor, they pop up in the natural world and in existing infrastructure. These are places where being effective requires deftly maneuvering through rocky trails, 
                 staircases, catwalks, doors or narrow cluttered passages. The environment can’t be conformed to the machine, and therefore the machine must be capable in the environment 
                 as it comes.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 While we take the natural world as inspiration for our robots, the design is ultimately motivated by functionality. Our robots end up moving like humans and animals not
                  because we designed them to look like humans and animals but because we made them balance. Balance and dynamic motion are characteristics we have previously only seen in 
                  animals. It is this organic quality of dynamically stable motion that people tend to associate with lifelike movement. Partly because of the benefits of dynamic motion, our 
                  robots can navigate tough unstructured, unknown or antagonistic terrain with ease. Wheeled and tracked robots are limited by stairs, gaps, ground-level obstructions such as 
                  cabling and staged materials and minor height differences in flooring. These environments don't present the same challenges for legged robots.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p><strong>Who funds Boston Dynamics?</strong></p>
            <p>
                Boston Dynamics is a privately held corporation, whose sole outside shareholder is Softbank. Softbank and Boston Dynamics have agreed to enter into a transaction in which Hyundai
                 Motor Group will acquire a majority interest in Boston Dynamics at some point in the future. In the first twenty years of our history, we proudly worked with research funding from
                  US Government agencies such as DARPA & the Army to develop robotic technology. That funding helped us to create the technical foundations for much of our present commercial work, 
                  similar to how DARPA funding led to other innovative technologies, such as the internet & GPS. Boston Dynamics occasionally receives offers of external research funding which the 
                  company considers based on alignment of the stated research goals with our internal goals to develop business applications in which robots enhance the productivity and safety of workers.
